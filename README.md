Configured private .env uses Atlas database hire_me. MONGODB_URL overrides legacy
MONGODB_URI; MONGODB_DB_NAME selects the database. Never copy credentials into frontend
variables, source or documents. AUTH_ENABLED defaults false in examples. The admin
auth:setup command generates/preserves private keys in all three backend environment files.
This module owns db:migrate, admin:provision, auth:setup, services:up and infra:check.

```powershell
npm.cmd run check
npm.cmd run format:check
npm.cmd run test:integration
npm.cmd run openapi
```

Integration checks require local Compose MongoDB on port 27018 (or TEST_MONGODB_URL).
They use uniquely named disposable databases and refuse remote/Atlas test URLs.
Provision an admin interactively with npm.cmd run admin:provision; enroll the displayed authenticator seed privately.

No sibling runtime imports. Local CI applies when this module is the GitHub repository root.

## Current Phase 2

Read [Phase 2 handover](docs/project/PHASE_2_HANDOVER.md), [domain specification](docs/project/PHASE_2_SPEC.md) and [API guide](docs/project/PHASE_2_API.md). Admin now has an explicitly permitted MFA-protected assisted-consent queue, evidence/distinct approval/withdrawal workflow and redacted support.

From this module run npm.cmd run phase2:setup and npm.cmd run db:migrate:phase2. Both have already been executed for the configured hire_me target. Use npm.cmd run consent:permissions privately for two distinct existing staff accounts. Ordinary admins have no consent permission automatically.

## GitHub setup

See [repository mapping and clone instructions](docs/project/GITHUB_REPOSITORIES.md). Private environment files are local only; use .env.example when setting up a new clone.
